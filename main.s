; Brief description of the program: Solution to Lab1
; The objective of this system is to implement a Car door signal system
; Hardware connections: Inputs are negative logic; output is positive logic
;  PF0 is right-door input sensor (1 means door is open, 0 means door is closed)
;  PF4 is left-door input sensor (1 means door is open, 0 means door is closed)
;  PF2 is Safe (Blue) LED signal - ON when both doors are closed, otherwise OFF
;  PF1 is Unsafe (Red) LED signal - ON when either (or both) doors are open, otherwise OFF
; The specific operation of this system 
;   Turn Unsafe LED signal ON if any or both doors are open, otherwise turn the Safe LED signal ON
;   Only one of the two LEDs must be ON at any time.
; NOTE: Do not use any conditional branches in your solution. 
;       We want you to think of the solution in terms of logical and shift operations
